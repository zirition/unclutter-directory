"""Action execution module for unclutter_directory.

This module provides the ActionExecutor class responsible for executing various file organization actions
such as moving files, deleting files/directories, and compressing files to ZIP archives.
It handles conflict resolution and path management for robust file operations.

Supported action types:
- 'move': Relocate files to specified target directories while preserving relative paths
- 'delete': Remove files or directories permanently
- 'compress': Archive files/directories into ZIP files with optional removal of originals

The module uses conflict resolution to avoid overwriting existing files and provides
comprehensive error handling for all file operations.
